Project: Landing Page.

The main objective of this project was to create a landing page from scratch, using this reference provided by The Odin Project: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png .

The images used in this project are found in https://www.pexels.com. I would like to thank the authors of the images: Andrea Piacquadio, Kyle Loftus, Lucas Pezeta, Martin Lopez, and Pietro Jeng.
